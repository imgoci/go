// credLookupTimeout is how long one credential lookup may take.

// A lookup usually reads a file and returns in microseconds, but a
// configuration that names a credential helper turns it into running someone
// else's program, and a program can hang. The bound is a constant rather than
// a knob: a transfer's deadline belongs to the caller's context, and this is
// only here so a wedged helper fails a transfer instead of stopping it
// forever.

// Store resolves credentials out of a Docker configuration file, the same way
// the Docker command line does: the entry under the registry's server
// address, or whatever the credential helper the file names prints for it.
//
// A Store never writes. It is built from one file path, which it reads once
// and keeps the parse of, and it is safe to use from several goroutines at
// once. A lookup either answers out of that parse or runs the credential
// helper the file named, which is asked afresh every time.
//
// A lookup may execute a credential helper program. The package
// documentation says what that means and why this package does it.

// caller who asked this package to use their credentials would otherwise watch
// it transfer anonymously and fail somewhere less obvious.
//
// The store is built with plaintext writes disabled and platform-store
// detection off. Neither is reachable through the port — it has one read
// method — but detection is not a write setting: with it on, a configuration
// file that names no helper falls through to the platform's own, so a lookup
// against an empty file would still execute docker-credential-osxkeychain and
// ask the developer's real keychain. This package runs a helper only when the
// file in front of it names one.
